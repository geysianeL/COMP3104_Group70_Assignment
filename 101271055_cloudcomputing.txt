Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses and developers approach software development and deployment. By providing on-demand access to scalable computing resources, cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud allow developers to build, test, and deploy applications without having to manage physical infrastructure. This flexibility reduces costs, improves scalability, and allows for quicker iterations. For businesses, cloud computing enables a more agile approach, where they can focus on delivering value to customers rather than managing hardware and data centers.
