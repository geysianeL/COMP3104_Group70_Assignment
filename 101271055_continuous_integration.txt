Continuous integration (CI) is a DevOps practice that involves regularly merging code changes into a shared repository to detect issues early. CI allows for automated testing to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality, speeding up the development process. By integrating frequently, developers can identify and address bugs sooner, leading to more reliable and stable software. This practice fosters better collaboration among team members, reducing integration problems and promoting smoother project progression.
