Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key component of DevOps, allowing developers to manage and provision infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. IaC tools like Terraform or Ansible automate the configuration of servers, networks, and other infrastructure components. This approach increases consistency, reduces human error, and makes scaling infrastructure easier. With IaC, development teams can ensure that environments are reproducible, making deployments faster, more efficient, and aligned with the agile methodology.
